== maven-rmi-plugin ==
The maven RMI plugin allows for running an RMI instance within a maven build.  Once ran, it will sit there until you press ctrl-c to break out of it.

Examples of configuration are in the pom.xml

Run the following...
mvn install

Modify your ~/.m2/settings.xml to allow plugins within the group...
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>ca.trentonadams.maven.plugins</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>
